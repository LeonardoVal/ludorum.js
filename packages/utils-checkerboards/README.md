[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/@ludorum/game-pig.png?mini=true)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ludorum/game-pig)

Ludorum is a board game framework. It is not focused on graphics or user interfaces, but on artificial players design, implementation and testing.

This package provides an implementation of the [Pig dice game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_%28dice_game%29), which is a very simple example of a non deterministic game (i.e. a game with random variables or _aleatories_).
