============================

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/@ludorum/game-connection.png?mini=true)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ludorum/game-mutropas)

Ludorum is a board game framework. It is not focused on graphics or user interfaces, but on artificial players design, implementation and testing.

This package provides a base implementation for connection games. These are games in two dimensional matrix-like boards, with playing placing pieces until a line of certain length is formed by either player, making them the winner. Good examples are [TicTacToe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe), [ConnectFour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) and [Gomoku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku).
